# My GitHub Portfolio

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jessica. Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, a collection of projects I've built to showcase my skills and passion for technology.

## About Me

I am a dedicated IT professional, soon to be a graduate of the Diploma of Information Technology at **Equinim College**. This program has equipped me with a strong foundation in Communication, Problem-Solving, Cybersecurity Fundamentals, Troubleshooting and Technical Support and Networking and Infrastructure.

I am passionate about learning and expanding my expertise, and I'm excited to announce that I will be starting **Diploma in Cyber Security in 2026**.

I am actively building and completing projects to gain practical experience and assist in securing a job in the tech industry. This repository serves as a central hub for easy access to my work.
